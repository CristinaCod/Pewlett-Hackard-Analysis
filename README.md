## Overview
### Purpose


## Results
•	
•	
•	We see a lot of employees with multiple job titles signifying they have switched positions over the years.
•	The two job titles that we’re seeing the largest retirement amounts in during this “silver tsunami” are in the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions with nearly 26,000 and 25,000 retirees each. The position we’re seeing the smallest number of retirees in are Managers with only 2. 

## Summary
o	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Based on the analysis we found that 72,458 positions will need to be filled due to the impending "silver tsunami". As mentioned above we are seeing the greatest hit in the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff titles so these should be the main focus for Pewlett-Hackard to fill those positions first. 

o	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees?

Based on the findings of the mentorship eligibility program, no, there are not enough retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. As mentioned above there are 72,458 employees retiring and only 1,549 eligible for the mentorship program. This averages out to about 1 mentor for every 47 new employees which is simply just unrealistic and not feasible.
